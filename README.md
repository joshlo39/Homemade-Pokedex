# Homemade Pokedex

This web app allows users to search for Pokemon and see their stats, abilities, and locations in Pokemon Go. The app was created using Streamlit, a Python library for building web apps.

## Usability Goals

The usability goals for the Homemade Pokedex were to:

* Make the app easy to use for both experienced and inexperienced Pokemon fans.
* Provide users with a comprehensive overview of each Pokemon, including their stats, abilities, and locations in Pokemon Go.
* Allow users to compare different Pokemon side-by-side.

## Design Process

The design process for the Homemade Pokedex began with sketching out a few different layouts. Once a basic layout was chosen, I started implementing the app using Streamlit. I used a combination of pre-built Streamlit widgets and custom code to create the app.

## API Integration

The Homemade Pokedex uses two APIs: the Pokemon API and the Pokemon Go API. The Pokemon API provides information about each Pokemon, such as their name, type, stats, and abilities. The Pokemon Go API provides information about where each Pokemon can be found in Pokemon Go.

## Interactive Widgets

The Homemade Pokedex uses a variety of interactive widgets, including:

* A dropdown menu to select a Pokemon.
* A bar chart to visualize a Pokemon's stats.
* A map to show where a Pokemon can be found in Pokemon Go.

## HCI Design Principles

The Homemade Pokedex adheres to a number of HCI design principles, including:

* **Visibility of system status:** The app provides clear and concise feedback to users about what is happening. For example, the bar chart shows the user's progress as they are selecting Pokemon.
* **User control and freedom:** The app gives users a high degree of control over their experience. For example, users can choose which Pokemon to view, and they can compare different Pokemon side-by-side.
* **Error prevention:** The app is designed to prevent errors as much as possible. For example, the app will not allow users to select a Pokemon that does not exist.
* **Aesthetic and minimalist design:** The app has a clean and minimalist design that is easy to use and navigate.

## Testing and Feedback

The Homemade Pokedex was tested with a small group of users. The feedback from the users was positive, and they found the app to be easy to use and informative. Based on the feedback, I made a few minor changes to the app, such as adding a button to show more stats for each Pokemon.

## Conclusion

The Homemade Pokedex is a web app that provides users with a comprehensive overview of each Pokemon. The app is easy to use and informative, and it adheres to a number of HCI design principles. I am happy with the results of the project, and I am excited to continue developing the app in the future.

## Potential Future Improvements

Some potential future improvements for the Homemade Pokedex include:

* Adding more information about each Pokemon, such as their weaknesses and strengths.
* Integrating with other Pokemon APIs to provide more information about each Pokemon.
* Adding a multiplayer mode so that users can compete with each other to collect Pokemon.
